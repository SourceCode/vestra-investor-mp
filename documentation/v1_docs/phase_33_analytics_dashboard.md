# Phase 33: Analytics Dashboard (Frontend)

## Objective
Visual dashboard for Org Admins.

## Dependencies
- Phase 32

## Tasks
1.  **Chart Library**
    - Install `recharts` or `chart.js`.

2.  **Dashboard Components**
    - "Big Number" Cards (Total Revenue, Active Deals).
    - Line Chart (New Investors over time).
    - Bar Chart (Deals by Stage).

3.  **Date Filtering**
    - Add date picker (Last 7 days, Last Month, YTD).

## Technical Considerations
- **Responsiveness**: Charts should resize gracefully.

## Verification
- Open Admin Dashboard.
- Charts render with data.
- Changing date range updates charts.
